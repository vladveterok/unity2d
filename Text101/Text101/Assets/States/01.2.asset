  storyText: 'Well, good, you gave yourself some time to look around. You see a table
    with lots of clutter under it. Also a door with the crack under it - too small
    but maybe you could fit into it. Behind their ugly back you see a window. It is
    opened just a little for fresh air - one strong jump and maybe you will consider
    yourself as a free being.


    1. Sneak under the table.

    2. Run to the door.

    3. Run to the window.'
